add datetest doctest here to demonstrate why calender widget can't be used.

a slight modification of calendar widget's macros
used in the MxDateTimeWidget could be an intermediate solution.

in future plone or even zope should be refractored to use a mxDateTime
compatible DateTime module that is also backward compatible.
